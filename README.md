ClosedXML Tutorial
==================

Back in 2017 I created a blog series on EPPlus
[Create Excels with C# and EPPlus: A tutorial](https://itenium.be/blog/dotnet/create-xlsx-excel-with-epplus-csharp/)
because it used to be such a great project. But then it went commercial üòÄ

So time to create a new blog series, now using the MIT licensed OpenXML!

[ClosedXML/ClosedXML](https://github.com/ClosedXML/ClosedXML) ClosedXML is a .NET library for reading, manipulating and writing Excel 2007+ (.xlsx, .xlsm) files. It aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to dealing with the underlying OpenXML API. (‚≠ê 5.2k)
